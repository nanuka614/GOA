<!--Semantic tags in HTML give meaning to the content inside them. 
They tell browsers and developers what kind of content is contained, improving readability and accessibility.-->

<!--<b> — Makes text bold visually, but has no extra meaning.

<i> — Makes text italic visually, usually for emphasis or technical terms.

<u> — Underlines text visually.

<em> — Emphasizes text; usually shown in italic, and signals importance semantically.

<strong> — Indicates strong importance; usually shown in bold, semantically stronger than <b>.

Which are Semantic Tags?

<em> and <strong> are semantic because they convey meaning (emphasis and importance).

<b>, <i>, and <u> are non-semantic; they only affect style without meaning.-->
